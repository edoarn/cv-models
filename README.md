# cv-models
Implementations of common computer vision deep learning models.


**There are better versions already out there with pretrained weights, why bother?**

Well, it's a bit for fun and a bit for learning purposes.


## Classification
CV models aimed at classification tasks, with a standard classifier head.
### Current models:
- ResNet variations (18, 34, 50, 101, 152)

## Segmentation
Models for semantic and/or instance segmentation, including backbones when necessary.

### Current backbones:
- ResNet variants (18, 34, 50, 101, 152)

### Current models
- UNet
- DeepLabV3
- DeepLabV3+ (WIP)
